# Sisyphus
A VSC Extension to help you create maintainable code.

We'll be starting with simpler stuff, like checking naming conventions, documentation coverage, test coverage etc. The point is to try to include much more complex features, such as refactor recommendations on lines considered as not readable enough, or find comment worthy lines.

We'll see where this projet leads, if it's ever done.

I cannot find enough informations on the architecture to have, or similar projets, so this projet will go through two main phases.
An initial developpement phase where I'll be learning from my mistakes in parallel, then a phase of heavy refactor to get a better code.
We'll see where this goes (that's gonna be the main theme of this project I feel like)
