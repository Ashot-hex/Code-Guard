# Code-Guard
A VSC Extension to help you create maintainable code.

We'll be starting with simpler stuff, like checking naming conventions, documentation coverage, test coverage etc. The point is to try to include much more complex features, such as refactor recommendations on lines considered as not readable enough, or find comment worthy lines.

We'll see where this projet leads, if it's ever done.
